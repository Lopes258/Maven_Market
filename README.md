Dashboard design

Going from left to right we have:

- A table showing the names of the products with their total number of transactions carried out, then the profit and profit margin and the average return.
  
- At the top we have 3 cards, one showing the number of transactions in the current month, then the profit and returns.
  
- Below the time cards is a map with the geographic density of where sales are located and on the left a diagram showing the proportion of sales for the TOP 3 selling countries.
  
- Below we have the weekly revenue showing a graph week by week.
  
- And finally a comparison of total revenue with target revenue.
